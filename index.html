<h3>Self-driving robot racing competition with the Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/09/09/formula-pi/">9th September 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From Barry Byford:</p>

<p>"<a href="https://www.formulapi.com/">Formula Pi</a> is a racing competition for software
developers to compete against each other to see how good their code is at
controlling a small autonomously vehicle.</p>

<p>The hardware is provided and maintained by the organisers so the vehicles are
identical removing that expense and complexity from competitors. This results
in a series that allows software engineers to compete purely on the
capabilities of their code. Competitors upload their code to vehicles via the
Formula Pi website and the races are streamed live on YouTube.</p>

<p>When competitors register they get access to a simulator for testing their code
as well as some example Python code to get started.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.piborg.org/formulapi-entry-winter2017">Registration</a> for the third
series of Formula Pi is open until 30th Septmber."</p>

<h3>The John Pinner Award</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/09/08/john-pinner-award/">8th September 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>We are pleased to announce that nominations for the first ever
<a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/">John Pinner Award</a> are open.</p>

<p>We want YOU to nominate people who freely contribute time and effort for the
good of the UK Python community but who generally don't get the sort of
recognition others may enjoy.  To be clear, this award celebrates community
rather than technical endeavours.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can think of that person who quietly organises your local user
group, runs workshops, mentors others online or creates educational resources
for others to re-use. It is the contributions of people like this who we'd like
to celebrate through this award.</p>

<p>You can nominate any number of people and the nomination process is very
simple. Full details can be found <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Get nominating!</p>

<h3>PyCon UK 2017 accommodation warning</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/08/30/pyconuk-accommodation-warning/">30th August 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>There are rumours that a heavyweight boxing match may be taking place in Cardiff on the Saturday of PyCon UK,
and so accommodation in the city has been snapped up much more quickly this year than usual.</p>

<p>If you're coming to the conference, <strong>you should book your accommodation now</strong>.
Donâ€™t delay any further!
If you leave it too late, you may find that there is no more affordable accommodation available.</p>

<p>We have set up a <a href="http://pyconukaccommodation.wikia.com/wiki/PyConUKAccommodation_Wiki">wiki</a>
for people to arrange sharing of rooms or rentals,
or for anybody in Cardiff to offer a room in their home.
(We can offer a free conference ticket to anybody in Cardiff who can put up visitors in their home.)</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/accommodation/">accommodation page</a> on our website for more details.</p>
