<h3>Django Girls at PyCon UK 2017</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/08/07/django-girls-at-pyconuk/">7th August 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From the organisers of Django Girls at PyCon UK:</p>

<p>"Are you female and want to learn how to make websites? Don’t know where to start? We have good news for you! We are holding a <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/django-girls/">one-day workshop at PyCon UK 2017</a> for beginners.  We believe the IT industry will benefit greatly from encouraging more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become one of us - female programmers! </p>

<p>Learning how to code can seem like an impossible task, so a Django Girls workshop at PyCon UK will show 30 programming beginners how it can be done and get them excited about the world of technology.</p>

<p>The Django Girls workshop is a crash course aimed at total beginners. You don’t need to know anything about programming, just bring your own laptop, have a sufficient understanding of English so you’re able to follow our English tutorial and be able to commit to the all-day workshop. You will work through the tutorial in a small group of three attendees and one coach so you’ll be able to do it at your own pace.</p>

<p>Django Girls was born in July 2014 in Berlin and today, Django Girls is a volunteer run organisation with hundreds of people contributing to bring more women to the Python and Django communities. Our goal is to bring more amazing women into the world of technology and increase the diversity in the Django community."</p>

<p>To register your interest in attending, please <a href="https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2017/apply/">fill in the application form</a>.</p>
