<h3>Self-driving robot racing competition with the Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/09/09/formula-pi/">9th September 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From Barry Byford:</p>

<p>"<a href="https://www.formulapi.com/">Formula Pi</a> is a racing competition for software
developers to compete against each other to see how good their code is at
controlling a small autonomously vehicle.</p>

<p>The hardware is provided and maintained by the organisers so the vehicles are
identical removing that expense and complexity from competitors. This results
in a series that allows software engineers to compete purely on the
capabilities of their code. Competitors upload their code to vehicles via the
Formula Pi website and the races are streamed live on YouTube.</p>

<p>When competitors register they get access to a simulator for testing their code
as well as some example Python code to get started.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.piborg.org/formulapi-entry-winter2017">Registration</a> for the third
series of Formula Pi is open until 30th Septmber."</p>

<h3>The John Pinner Award</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/09/08/john-pinner-award/">8th September 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>We are pleased to announce that nominations for the first ever
<a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/">John Pinner Award</a> are open.</p>

<p>We want YOU to nominate people who freely contribute time and effort for the
good of the UK Python community but who generally don't get the sort of
recognition others may enjoy.  To be clear, this award celebrates community
rather than technical endeavours.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can think of that person who quietly organises your local user
group, runs workshops, mentors others online or creates educational resources
for others to re-use. It is the contributions of people like this who we'd like
to celebrate through this award.</p>

<p>You can nominate any number of people and the nomination process is very
simple. Full details can be found <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Get nominating!</p>
