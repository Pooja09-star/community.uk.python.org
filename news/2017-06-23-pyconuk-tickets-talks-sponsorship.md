title: PyCon UK tickets, talks, and sponsorship
newsletter_month: 2016-07
---
Following a slight holiday-related hitch,
tickets for PyCon UK 2017 will now go on sale slightly later than planned
on July 2nd on the [conference website](http://2017.pyconuk.org/).

We'll also open the [Call for Participation](http://2017.pyconuk.org/cfp/) then,
and we'd like to see proposals of all sorts for talks, workshops, posters — or anything else —
from all parts of the community.
We're especially interested in proposals from first-time speakers,
and we'll be able to provide mentorship and advice to all speakers who request it.

On the same day, we'll be opening applications for financial assistance,
and we have allocated a significant proportion of our conference budget towards
ensuring that attending the conference is as affordable as possible.

Finally, we're also looking for conference sponsors.
Sponsoring the conference is the best way for your company to engage with the UK Python community,
whether you want to recruit Python engineers,
promote your products,
or raise your profile.
Sponsors get free conference tickets,
a space to exhibit during the conference,
promotion online and in this newsletter,
and (for higher-level sponsors) guaranteed space on the programme.
If you're interested, please take a look at our [sponsorship prospectus](http://2017.pyconuk.org/sponsorship/).
