From Peter Inglesby, PyCon UK chair:

"I've been producing UK Python News since last autumn,
and it's now in a state where I'd be happy to hand it over to somebody else.

There are number of different aspects to the work:

 * collecting events happening around the country (although this is fairly well automated now)
 * keeping an eye out for interesting news items
 * improving the automation to gather events and collate the website and newsletter
 * enhancing the design of the website

If you'd like to chat more about what taking on any of this would involve,
please drop me a line at peter.inglesby@gmail.com."
