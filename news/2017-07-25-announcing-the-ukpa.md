---
The PyCon UK committee have recently registered the the
[UK Python Association](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1173471)
as a [Charitable Incorporated Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_incorporated_organisation)
with the Charity Commission.

The UKPA is a membership organisation, and in the first instance, anybody who attends PyCon UK 2017 is entitled to membership.
For now, membership entitles you to vote to elect the organisation's trustees.
You can indicate that you would like to join the UKPA when you [buy a ticket for the conference](http://2017.pyconuk.org/tickets/),
or if you already have a ticket, when you [fill out your profile](https://hq.pyconuk.org/profile/).

We are looking to elect up to six trustees for the UKPA at the first AGM on the Saturday of the conference.
The trustees will be responsible for the charity's management and administration,
and will be responsible for appointing a chair for PyCon UK 2018.

If you would like to put yourself forward for election as trustee,
please complete the [nomination form](https://hq.pyconuk.org/profile/ukpa/nominations/new/)
by Thursday 12th October.

You can read more about the decision-making behind the formation of the UKPA
