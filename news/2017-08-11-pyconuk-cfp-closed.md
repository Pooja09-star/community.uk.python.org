title: The PyCon UK CFP has closed

The PyCon UK CFP has closed, and we're bowled over by the number of excellent submissions we've had.

The conference committee will be mulling over the programme over the next couple of weeks, and we'll have some very difficult decisions to make.  In the meantime, we'd like to thank everybody who's submitted a proposal.
