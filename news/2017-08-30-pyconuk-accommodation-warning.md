title: PyCon UK 2017 accommodation warning
newsletter_month: 2017-09
---
There are rumours that a heavyweight boxing match may be taking place in Cardiff on the Saturday of PyCon UK,
and so accommodation in the city has been snapped up much more quickly this year than usual.

If you're coming to the conference, **you should book your accommodation now**.
Donâ€™t delay any further!
If you leave it too late, you may find that there is no more affordable accommodation available.

We have set up a [wiki](http://pyconukaccommodation.wikia.com/wiki/PyConUKAccommodation_Wiki)
for people to arrange sharing of rooms or rentals,
or for anybody in Cardiff to offer a room in their home.
(We can offer a free conference ticket to anybody in Cardiff who can put up visitors in their home.)

Please see the [accommodation page](http://2017.pyconuk.org/accommodation/) on our website for more details.
