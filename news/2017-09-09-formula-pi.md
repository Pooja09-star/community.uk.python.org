From Barry Byford:

"[Formula Pi](https://www.formulapi.com/) is a racing competition for software
developers to compete against each other to see how good their code is at
controlling a small autonomously vehicle.

The hardware is provided and maintained by the organisers so the vehicles are
identical removing that expense and complexity from competitors. This results
in a series that allows software engineers to compete purely on the
capabilities of their code. Competitors upload their code to vehicles via the
Formula Pi website and the races are streamed live on YouTube.

When competitors register they get access to a simulator for testing their code
as well as some example Python code to get started.

[Registration](https://www.piborg.org/formulapi-entry-winter2017) for the third
series of Formula Pi is open until 30th Septmber."
