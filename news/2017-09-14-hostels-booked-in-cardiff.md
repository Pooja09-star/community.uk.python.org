Following confirmation that a [world title heavyweight boxing match](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/41152241) is taking place in Cardiff over the weekend of the conference, we have made reservations for around 200 beds for conference delegates in hostels in Cardiff.

If you are coming to the conference and have not yet reserved accommodation, please do so as soon as possible!  Ticketholders can book accommodation through the [ticketing website](https://hq.pyconuk.org/accommodation/bookings/new/).

For more information, see the [accommodation page](http://2017.pyconuk.org/accommodation/) on the conference website.
