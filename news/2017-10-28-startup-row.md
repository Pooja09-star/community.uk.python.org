From Mario Corchero:

"For the first time, London is hosting a Startup Row Pitch Event on November 27th at Bloomberg LP's London office.

This is a contest (organised by the Python Software Foundation) for startups who use Python, where the winner gets a booth at PyCon US in May 2018.

This is has proven extremely useful for startups as it is a great way to attract funding, and there is a really useful networking event at PyCon US for all the winners.

Alumni include companies like Docker and Lambda Foundry."
