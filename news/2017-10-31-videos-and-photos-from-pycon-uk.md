The [conference photographer](http://composedimages.co.uk/) has made his photos available [on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152472562@N06/).  Do take a look!

And Tim Williams has been hard at work getting videos of talks from the conference online.  Many are already on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChA9XP_feY1-1oSy2L7acog), with more to follow in the next few days.
