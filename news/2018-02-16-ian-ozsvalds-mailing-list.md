title: Ian Ozsvald's Data Science jobs list
newsletter_month: 2018-03

From Ian Ozsvald (of [PyData London](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/) fame):

"I run a jobs email list focused on Data Scientist and Data Engineer jobs for
Pythonistas. A jobs email is sent every 2 weeks containing 7-10 jobs, there's a
focus towards London and the jobs reach across the UK and into Western Europe.
Currently there are over 900 people on the list and a set have found new roles
via this list. Advertising companies range from start-ups to the BBC, Cambridge
University and Last.fm. Your email is never shared with anyone else, the list
is controlled by mailchimp so you can unsubscribe at any time.

Here's a quote from one of the list members (Frank is a co-founder of
PyDataBristol).

> I’m very grateful for Ian’s job list as it enabled me to find a Data Science
> job in an interesting and meaningful domain, and furthermore connected me with
> likeminded folk. Strongly recommend. – Frank Kelly, Senior Data Scientist
> @HAL24K
