The Python Software Foundation have launched a donation drive, and are aiming to raise $20,000 by the middle of May.

Donations support sprints, meetups, community events, Python documentation, fiscal sponsorships, software development, and community projects.

We all benefit from the critical work the PSF does to support the language and the community, and we encourage you to consider donating (and to ask your employers to do the same).
