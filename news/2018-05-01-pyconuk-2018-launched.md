This year's PyCon UK will be held once again at Cardiff City Hall, 15th to 19th September.

[**Tickets**](https://2018.pyconuk.org/tickets/) are on sale now.

The [**Call for Proposals**](https://2018.pyconuk.org/call-proposals/) is open.

We're taking applications for [**financial assistance**](https://2018.pyconuk.org/financial-assistance/).

The website has information about [**travel and accommodation**](https://2018.pyconuk.org/travel-accommodation/), with discounts available on both.
  
We'll have [a free cr√®che, a live speech-to-text service, mobility and accessibility support, and more](https://2018.pyconuk.org/diversity-inclusion-accessibility/).

As well as a full programme of talks and workshops, we have a number of social and evening sessions planned.

We're also seeking **[commercial sponsorship](https://2018.pyconuk.org/sponsorship/)**. Please get in touch if you think you can help, because the conference only runs each year with the generous support it receives from its sponsors.

As usual, the conference is run by a committee of volunteers, on behalf of the Python community, and once again, we aim to make it the very best possible experience for our attendees.

If you do anything at all with Python, whatever your level of experience, there'll be a lot at PyCon UK for you.
