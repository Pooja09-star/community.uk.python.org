title: Changes to the UK Python News mailing list
newsletter_month: 2018-06
---
The what:

* We're closing the UK Python News mailing list and starting a new one, which will by operated by the UK Python Association
* We'd like you to sign up to the new one!
* You can do so [here](http://eepurl.com/dv4grb)
* You'll receive monthly emails with news about the UK Python community, including about PyCon UK
* You can unsubscribe at any time
* The mailing list is operated by MailChimp
* The UKPA will never share your contact details with anybody (apart from MailChimp)

The why:

* We're doing this for two reasons:
  * GDPR (and specifically: we automatically signed up attendees to PyCon UK 2016 to this mailing list, and shouldn't have done (sorry))
  * We're slowly transferring the assets of the PyCon UK Society Ltd to the UK Python Association, and we're not quite sure of the best way to transfer a mailing list. You can read more about the UKPA here.
