From the PyCon UK committee:

We've published the [draft programme for PyCon UK 2018](http://2018.pyconuk.org/programme).

This will be firmed up over the coming days, and we still have to announce the
keynote speakers we have lined up for the event.

In the meantime, our selection of speakers - by far the hardest we've ever had
to make, taken from the nearly 250 proposals that came in - represents the
breadth of interests in the Python community, and is aimed at a wide range of
levels of technical expertise.

There are still plenty of opportunities to be part of the event, as an [attendee](https://2018.pyconuk.org/tickets/)
or a [sponsor](https://2018.pyconuk.org/sponsorship/) - join us in Cardiff in September!
