Nominations for the 2018 [John Pinner Award](/john-pinner-award/) are open.

The John Pinner Award celebrates voluntary service to the Python community in
the UK, and recognises those who freely contribute their time and effort for
the good of the community.

Recipients of the award will be announced at PyCon UK in September.

Perhaps you can think of that person who quietly organises your local user
group, runs workshops, mentors others online, or creates educational resources
for others to re-use.  It is the contributions of people like this who we'd
like to celebrate through this award.

You can nominate any number of people and the nomination process is very
simple. Full details can be found [here](/john-pinner-award/).

Get nominating!
