From the PyCon UK committee:

We have now published the [full schedule for PyCon UK 2018](https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/schedule/).

We're also excited to announce our keynote speakers:

* On Saturday, Alex Chan will be talking to us about trust, and how to build
systems that encourage trust and good behaviour. Alex is a software developer
at Wellcome Collection and a PyCon UK organiser.

* On Sunday, for our education track, we have Sue Sentance to tell us about
programming in schools, and what’s in a teacher’s toolkit. Sue is Chief
Learning Officer at the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

* On Monday we are pleased to welcome Loek van Gent who is joining us to talk
about social responsibility, social good, and collaborating in Python. Loek is
Head of Engineering at GoodUp in Amsterdam.

* And finally, on Tuesday joining us will be Nikoleta Glynatsi, who uses Python
and maths to unpick the secrets of the forces that maintain the relationships
between things in the world. Nikoleta is a doctoral student in mathematics at
Cardiff University.

There are still plenty of opportunities to be part of the event, as an [attendee](https://2018.pyconuk.org/tickets/)
