<h3>Django Girls at PyCon UK 2017</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/08/07/django-girls-at-pyconuk/">7th August 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From the organisers of Django Girls at PyCon UK:</p>

<p>"Are you female and want to learn how to make websites? Don’t know where to start? We have good news for you! We are holding a <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/django-girls/">one-day workshop at PyCon UK 2017</a> for beginners.  We believe the IT industry will benefit greatly from encouraging more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become one of us - female programmers! </p>

<p>Learning how to code can seem like an impossible task, so a Django Girls workshop at PyCon UK will show 30 programming beginners how it can be done and get them excited about the world of technology.</p>

<p>The Django Girls workshop is a crash course aimed at total beginners. You don’t need to know anything about programming, just bring your own laptop, have a sufficient understanding of English so you’re able to follow our English tutorial and be able to commit to the all-day workshop. You will work through the tutorial in a small group of three attendees and one coach so you’ll be able to do it at your own pace.</p>

<p>Django Girls was born in July 2014 in Berlin and today, Django Girls is a volunteer run organisation with hundreds of people contributing to bring more women to the Python and Django communities. Our goal is to bring more amazing women into the world of technology and increase the diversity in the Django community."</p>

<p>To register your interest in attending, please <a href="https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2017/apply/">fill in the application form</a>.</p>

<h3>Could you edit UK Python News?</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/06/28/could-you-edit-uk-python-news/">28th June 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From Peter Inglesby, PyCon UK chair:</p>

<p>"I've been producing UK Python News since last autumn,
and it's now in a state where I'd be happy to hand it over to somebody else.</p>

<p>There are number of different aspects to the work:</p>

<ul>
<li>collecting events happening around the country (although this is fairly well automated now)</li>
<li>keeping an eye out for interesting news items</li>
<li>improving the automation to gather events and collate the website and newsletter</li>
<li>enhancing the design of the website</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to chat more about what taking on any of this would involve,
please drop me a line at peter.inglesby@gmail.com."</p>

  <p>Following a slight holiday-related hitch,
tickets for PyCon UK 2017 will now go on sale slightly later than planned
on July 2nd on the <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/">conference website</a>.</p>

<p>We'll also open the <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/cfp/">Call for Participation</a> then,
and we'd like to see proposals of all sorts for talks, workshops, posters — or anything else —
from all parts of the community.
We're especially interested in proposals from first-time speakers,
and we'll be able to provide mentorship and advice to all speakers who request it.</p>

<p>On the same day, we'll be opening applications for financial assistance,
and we have allocated a significant proportion of our conference budget towards
ensuring that attending the conference is as affordable as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, we're also looking for conference sponsors.
Sponsoring the conference is the best way for your company to engage with the UK Python community,
whether you want to recruit Python engineers,
promote your products,
or raise your profile.
Sponsors get free conference tickets,
a space to exhibit during the conference,
promotion online and in this newsletter,
and (for higher-level sponsors) guaranteed space on the programme.
If you're interested, please take a look at our <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/sponsorship/">sponsorship prospectus</a>.</p>
