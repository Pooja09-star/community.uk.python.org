title: John Pinner Award
---
The John Pinner Award celebrates voluntary service to the Python community in
the UK.

It is awarded annually at PyCon UK to those who freely contribute their time
and effort for the good of the community.  Recipients are given a Pythonic
medal and a free ticket to the next year's conference.

Nominations are made by members of the community, and recipients are chosen
based on these nominations by a small panel of previous recipients, chaired by
a UKPA trustee.

### About John

John Pinner founded PyCon UK in 2007, and organised the conference until his
death in 2015. He was the personification of a Pythonista who gave his time,
code and effort to the community. He was a role model, mentor and teacher who
is sorely missed.

With the blessing of the Pinner family, the UKPA is initiating the award to
honour and remember John's extraordinary contribution to our community.
