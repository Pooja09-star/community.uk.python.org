title: John Pinner Award
---
The John Pinner Award celebrates voluntary service to the Python community in
the UK.

It is awarded annually at PyCon UK to those who freely contribute their time
and effort for the good of the community.

Nominations are made by members of the community, and recipients are chosen
based on these nominations by a small panel of previous recipients, chaired by
a UKPA trustee.


### 2018 awards

Nominations from members of the UK Python community are now open for the 2018
awards, via the form below.  You may make as many nominations as you like.

The form will close at 12:00 BST on 1st September, and the recipients of the
award will be announced during PyCon UK.

The awards will be administered by Peter Inglesby, Cat Lamin, and Tim Golden.

### About John

John Pinner founded PyCon UK in 2007, and organised the conference until his
death in 2015. He was the personification of a Pythonista who gave his time,
code and effort to the community. He was a role model, mentor and teacher who
is sorely missed.

With the blessing of the Pinner family, the UKPA is initiating the award to
honour and remember John's extraordinary contribution to our community.
