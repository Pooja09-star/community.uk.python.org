[Osirium](https://osirium.com/) lives in the world of Privileged Access and
Privileged Task Management.  This means that we separate people from passwords,
provide single sign on with role based credentials and allow users to run
privileged tasks without them needing privileges the tasks needs. We use
Python, lots of Python, it’s an enterprise class security product that relays
many data sessions across a virtual (in privilege) air gap at near zero
latency. It needs a sassy UI and analytics that succinctly inform humans who
did what where and when. It’s a challenge and we love it.
